Fair warning, he's kind of an odd ball.

Crunchy Games is a team of 4 goobers, founded
by Dominic Kolp ( @stupidlilgoober ) and David
Swarthout (@QR-cre8tes ) at a school lunch table.

With Dom and Nathaniel ( @NCsources0 ) as programmers,
Ben ( @ThisThis48 ) for sound design, David as designer
and founder ( Dom is co-founder ) and IDK ( that's her
nickname... she doesn't have a GitHub ), we make some
random things once in a while.

## What are we working on?
Tons of miscellaneous things. We don't really have much
of a direction as of current, as most of us are unskilled,
but we are open for suggestions. You can also find the
co-founder's personal [website.](https://StupidLilGoober.github.io)

## Meet the team

## Are we chill with modding, forking, etc.?
Absolutely! Most games have built-in modding support
through Lua (I, Dom, have been considering Grug for a 
while), and all of our free games (including demos) are
open source.

Once we stop working on the game, we will open source
the game so that people who enjoy the game can continue
it.

We love the gaming, modding, and programming community. The
collaboration achieved matches almost no other medium, 
and that's impressive!
