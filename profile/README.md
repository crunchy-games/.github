Fair warning, he's kind of an odd ball.

Crunchy Games is a team of 4 goobers, founded
by Dominic Kolp ( @stupidlilgoober ) and David
Swarthout (@QR-cre8tes ) at a school lunch table.

With Dom and Nathaniel ( @NCsources0 ) as programmers,
Ben ( @ThisThis48 ) for sound design, David as designer
and founder ( Dom is co-founder ) and IDK ( that's her
nickname... she doesn't have a GitHub ), we make some
random things once in a while.

## What are we working on?
Tons of miscellaneous things. We don't really have much
of a direction as of current, as most of us are unskilled,
but we are open for suggestions. You can also find the
co-founder's personal [website.](https://StupidLilGoober.github.io)
