Also, one of our guys has a YT channel [here](https://youtube.com/@ambailgail?si=ra9xS-KU4PCYLrmI). Fair warning, he's kind of an oddball.

Crunchy Games is a team of 4 goobers, founded by Dominic Kolp ( @stupidlilgoober ) and David Swarthout (@QR-cre8tes ) at a school lunch table.

With Dom and @NCsources0 as programmers, Ben ( @ThisThis48 ) for sound design, David as designer and founder ( Dom is co-founder ), and IDK ( that's their nickname... she doesn't have a GitHub ), we make some random things once in a while.

## Are we chill with modding?
Absolutely! Most games have built-in modding support through Lua, and all of our free games (including demos) are open-source.

Once we stop working on the game, we will open-source it so that people who enjoy the game can continue it.

We love the gaming, modding, and programming community. The collaboration achieved matches almost no other medium. That's impressive!

## Tech we use
Our primary language is C/C++ and Lua for scripting and config files. That way, everyone is capable of working on the games.

For the web, we do it the most bog-standard way possible. We raw-dog HTML, CSS, and JS just as God intended.
